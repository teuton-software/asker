The other 10%, It's luck and time wasted working.

## Open vs closed problems

The big problem with test questions are that only are usefull to evaluate
measurable features. So it is useless when we try measure abstract
features or measure open problems. But I think, we can do it with another approach.

I mean, if we get an open and abstract problem, their resolution will consist on several steps or measurable milestones. So we can transform an open problem, into a lot of closed mini-problems. And we have to focus on the measurable aspects.

Besides, if I *"bomb"* the student with a huge amount of diferent test questions about one concept, probably I could be near of knowing and measuring, the student asimilation of that kownledge.

## Making Questions

The task of creating test questions to solve the previous problem, becames another different problem to be solved. When I had to make manually this test questions, it took me a lot of time. And I need a lot.

And usually when I was making the question number 42, I realise that I forgot the content of the 41 previous. I'm loosing time and it's slow.

## Work once

Finally, I decide to write this tool that help me with the process of
making test questions from input definition files.

So I only waste time making an input file. But as a teacher I have this
into my mind and it must be a simple job. Because the inpu file it's just a resumed concepts list about the unit I'm teaching.

I've been using this tools several years/courses, teaching computer
science. I have a lot of functions to be improved and features to be added.
But for now, It's usefull (for me at least), and hope it will be for you too.

Thanks!
